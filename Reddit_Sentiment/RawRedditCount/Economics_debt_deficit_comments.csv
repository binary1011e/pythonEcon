The limit is hit. The charges don't go through; this adds penalty charges that also don't go through. You start getting phone calls from debt collectors and your credit rating takes a hit.

In the case of a shutdown, when it ends, the government pays the extra penalties and tries to smooth over that it was ever in arrears. So it cos...",/r/Economics/comments/1ho6ykk/janet_yellen_issues_warning_to_congress_as_us/m48mvow/

The US never collects enough revenue; it gives out tax cuts; and other giveaways.

Reagan started the US National Debt crisis. He failed to ""pay for"" all his spending.

The Republicans called it ""necessary spending"" -- but they never paid for any of it.

If it's necessary than it should be paid for -- therefore, it becomes a REVENUE problem.

You can't bullshit average Americans they need to give up their social...",/r/Economics/comments/1hplfgr/trump_on_collision_course_with_conservatives_over/m4jh4ja/

His rhetoric around government ""ineffectiveness"" sowed public distrust in government's ability to perform vital services, even as he proceeded to blow up the national debt.

But even without that, if government debt is really a problem, why would you support to reduce its revenue and its ability to repay debt?",/r/Economics/comments/1hpv70a/why_the_debt_fight_is_going_to_get_even_worse/m4plyt6/

I think the ""digital ruble"" will be interesting to watch in an academic sense.

Also appreciate the shout-out to Elvira Nabiullina. I think it's telling that when she tried to resign at the outbreak of the war, Putin straight up refused to accept her resignation - he knows exactly how lucky he is to have her, and the fact she basically has his unwavering support in a system that usually doesn't provide that, is telling.
