3. The National debt is about $9.133 trillion.

Suppose a tax (surcharge) of 20% was levied on the top 20% of Americans for ONE YEAR.

Do the math: $56.2 trillion times 85% equals $47.77 trillion. 20% times $47.77 trillion equals $9.554 trillion. $9.554 trillion - $9.133 trillion equals $421 billion, the interest for a year.
