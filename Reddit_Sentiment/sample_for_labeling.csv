Right now, we are having Social Security and Medicare taken out of our taxes to pay the bills of the older generations.  These are the people indirectly responsible for the national debt, because of the leaders they elected that got us into this mess.  And the sad truth is that we will be paying for this with fewer benefits and higher taxes in 20 years time.

The US [national debt](http://www.usdebtclock.org/) stands at $15.7 trillion.

Also I think it's crucial that we address the national debt which will have endless implications in the ..."

* 1945-1973: WWII debt gradually paid off with responsible budget (debt held flat while GDP increases, meaning debt/GDP ratio decreases)
